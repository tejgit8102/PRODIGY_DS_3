# Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive models that aid financial institutions in targeting clients with a higher likelihood of subscribing to term deposits. By accurately pinpointing potential subscribers, the institution can enhance its marketing strategies and boost the efficiency of its campaigns.

## Dataset

This project utilizes a dataset derived from direct marketing campaigns (via phone calls) conducted by a Portuguese bank. The dataset encompasses various attributes including client demographics, prior marketing interactions, and the outcome of the marketing efforts (i.e., whether or not the client subscribed to a term deposit).

## Results

We developed decision tree classifiers using two different criteria: Gini impurity and entropy. Both models demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting term deposit subscriptions. Notably, the Gini impurity criterion showed a slight edge over entropy, exhibiting superior testing accuracy and recall for the positive class.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting client subscriptions to term deposits during direct marketing campaigns. By applying predictive analytics, the financial institution can refine its marketing approaches and improve customer engagement.
